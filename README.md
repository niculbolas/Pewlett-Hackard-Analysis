# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Purpose:
The purpose of this project was to dig into 6 CSV files provided by company Pewlett Hackard in order to determine how many employees they expect to retire soon.  A further breakdown of expected retirees per department and per title were to be done as well.  In addition, the company also wished to know how many employees would be eligible to join a mentoring program in order to provide new hires the skills in order to succeed in the industry.

## Results:
- A quick query of the employees.csv file reveals that Pewlett Hackard currently employees 300024 employees.  See figure 1.

- The next important result is the company has 72458 employees that will become eligible, or are already eligible, for retirement.  .See figure 2.

- Of those 72458 impending retirees, 25916 are Senior Engineers, 24926 are Senior Staff, 9285 are Engineers, 7636 are Staff, 3603 are Technique leaders, 1090 are Assistant Engineers, and 2 are managers.  See figure 2.

- Since the company has 300024 employees and 72458 of them will be, or already are, eligile to retire soon that means Pewlett Hackard could lose up to a staggering 24.2% of its workforce.  The company had better prepare for a hiring spree!

## Summary:
Q1: How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

A: This was answered in the results section above under the 3rd bullet.  Also, please see figure 2.

Q2: Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

A: A count of the employees eligible for the mentorship program shows that 1549 employees are eligible.  Given that 72458 will be retiring in the near future, the number of employees eligible for the mentoring program is woefully lacking.  See figure 3.

### Additional Query 1:
I would suggest that Pewlett Hackard look into its hiring practices pretty seriously.  A query of the employee data reveals that there are no employees working there that were born after 12-31-1965.  My query returned 0 results.  See figure 4.

### Additional Query 2:
The next suggestion I would make is that the company expand the eligibility for the mentorship program.  For example, by expanding the program to include those born between 1962 and 1965 the number of employees eligible for the program jumped to 56859 which is a marked improvement from the previous 1549 eligible.  See figure 5.
